### ADVANCE COMMANDS OF LINUX :

# PS - AUX
The `ps aux` command in Linux is used to **display information about all running processes** on the system. It's a combination of options passed to the `ps` (process status) command.

--- sc

### üîß Command Breakdown: `ps aux`

* **`ps`** ‚Äì The base command to report a snapshot of current processes.
* **`a`** ‚Äì Show processes for **all users**, not just the current user.
* **`u`** ‚Äì Display the process's user/owner and **show in a user-oriented format** (includes user, CPU %, memory %, etc.).
* **`x`** ‚Äì Include processes that are **not attached to a terminal** (like daemons or background services).

---

# PROCESS TREE

The `pstree -p` command in Linux shows **running processes in a tree format**, displaying **parent-child relationships**, and includes the **Process IDs (PIDs)**.

---

### üßæ Syntax:

```bash
pstree -p
```

### OUTPUT

![UVB](../images/pstreep.png)

### üìò What It Does:

* `pstree`: Displays processes as a tree.
* `-p`: Shows the **PID** of each process alongside the name.

---


### ‚úÖ Why Use `pstree -p`?

* See **hierarchical structure** of processes.
* Identify which process **spawned which** (e.g., for debugging).
* Understand **zombie or orphan processes** by looking at parent-child relationships.
* Helps track how **services** or **scripts** spawn child processes.

---

### üîß More Useful Options:

* `pstree -p <PID>` ‚Äî Show the subtree **starting from a specific PID**.
* `pstree -u` ‚Äî Also show the **user** who owns each process.
* `pstree -a` ‚Äî Show **command-line arguments** for each process.
* `pstree -c` ‚Äî Do **not collapse identical subtrees**.

# REAL TIME MONITORING:
The `top` command in Linux is a **real-time, dynamic system monitoring tool**. It provides a live, continuously updated view of:

* **Processes** running on the system
* **CPU and memory usage**
* **Load average**
* **System uptime**
* **Resource usage by user/process**

---

### üßæ Basic Usage:

```bash
top
```

This opens a full-screen terminal interface that updates every few seconds.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Interactive Commands Inside `top`

While `top` is running, you can interact with it:

* `q` ‚Äì Quit
* `P` ‚Äì Sort by **CPU usage**
* `M` ‚Äì Sort by **memory usage**
* `T` ‚Äì Sort by **runtime**
* `k` ‚Äì **Kill** a process (you‚Äôll be prompted for PID)
* `r` ‚Äì **Renice** a process
* `u` ‚Äì Show processes for a specific **user**
* `1` ‚Äì Show CPU usage **per core**

---

---

# ADJUST PROCESS PRIORITY:
In Linux, **adjusting process priority** means changing its **"nice" value**, which affects how much CPU time it gets relative to other processes.

There are two main ways to do this:

---

## üîº 1. **Start a Process with a Priority** ‚Äî using `nice`

```bash
nice -n 10 sleep 300 &
```

* Priority range: `-20` (highest priority) to `19` (lowest).
* Default is `0`.
* Only **root** can use negative (high) priorities.

---

## üîÅ 2. **Change Priority of an Existing Process** ‚Äî using `renice`

```bash
renice -n -5 -p 4646
```


* Again, only **root** can set negative nice values.
* Use `top` or `ps aux` to find the PID of the process first.

---

### OUTPUT:

![UV](../images/nice.png)

### üìå Notes:

* A **lower nice value = higher priority**.
* A **higher nice value = lower priority**.
* The **default nice value** is usually `0`.
* **Nice value ‚â† real-time scheduling**. For real-time control, use `chrt`, but that's more advanced and rarely needed outside of specific workloads.

---

### ‚úÖ Check Priority:

# CPU AFFINITY (BIND PROCESS TO CPU CORE) :

Binding a process to a specific CPU core(s) in Linux is called setting its **CPU affinity**. This can help with performance tuning, load balancing, or isolating processes.

---

## üß† What is CPU Affinity?

**CPU affinity** defines the set of CPU cores on which a process is allowed to run. By default, processes can run on any core, but you can restrict them to specific cores using:

* `taskset` (command-line tool)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Using `taskset`**

# INPUT:

```bash
taskset -cp 4646
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Numbering

CPU cores are zero-indexed:

| Core  | Number      |
| ----- | ----------- |
| CPU 0 | First core  |
| CPU 1 | Second core |
| ...   | ...         |

Use `lscpu` or `nproc` to check the number of cores available.

---

## OUTPUT:

![UVY](../images/taskset.png)


# I/O SCHEDULING PRIORITY :

### üßæ I/O Scheduling Priority in Linux

In Linux, **I/O priority** controls how the kernel schedules disk I/O for processes, just like **CPU priority** controls CPU time. It can be especially useful when you want to:

* Prioritize a database or service that needs fast disk access.
* Throttle background tasks (like backups) to avoid slowing down the system.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used: `ionice`

### Basic syntax:

```bash
ionice -c <class> -n <priority> -p <PID>
```

# INPUT:
```
bash
ionice -c 3 -p 4646
```
---

## üéõÔ∏è I/O Priority Classes

There are **three scheduling classes**:

| Class                     | Code | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Idle**                  | `3`  | Process only gets I/O when no one else needs it.            |
| **Best Effort** (default) | `2`  | Normal I/O scheduling. Can assign priority levels (`0‚Äì7`).  |
| **Real Time**             | `1`  | Highest priority ‚Äî used with care. Can hog disk. Root only. |

> üéØ **Lower numbers = higher priority** (just like `nice` values)

---

# FILE DESCRIPTION USED BY A PROCESS :

To view **file descriptors (FDs)** used by a process in Linux, you're essentially asking:
üîç *"What files, sockets, pipes, etc., is this process using?"*

Every open file, socket, pipe, etc., is assigned a **file descriptor** by the kernel (numbered `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.).

---

## üîß View File Descriptors for a Process

### 1. **List Open File Descriptors**

```bash
ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd
```

### Example:

```bash
ls -l /proc/1234/fd
```

This shows all open FDs for process `1234`, like:

```
lrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 25 10:30 0 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 25 10:30 1 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 user user 64 Sep 25 10:30 2 -> /dev/pts/0
lr-x------ 1 user user 64 Sep 25 10:30 3 -> /var/log/syslog
```

* `0` = stdin
* `1` = stdout
* `2` = stderr
* Higher numbers are additional FDs: files, sockets, pipes, etc.

---

### 2. **Use `lsof` (List Open Files)**

```bash
lsof -p <PID>
```


---

# OUTPUT:
![gu](../images/pshead.png)

![jh](../images/proc.png)

![UGI](../images/image-10.png)


### 3. **Count the Number of Open FDs**

```bash
ls /proc/<PID>/fd | wc -l
```
# OUTPUT:

![guv](../images/countpid.png)

---

# TRACE SYSTEM CALLS OF A PROCESS :
To **trace system calls** made by a process in Linux, you typically use the `strace` command. It shows every **syscall** (like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `execve()`, etc.) that a process makes ‚Äî very useful for debugging, troubleshooting, and understanding how programs interact with the kernel.

---

## üîß 1. **Trace a New Process**

```bash
strace <command>
``` x

---

## üîç 2. **Attach to an Existing Process**

```bash
sudo strace -p 4646
```

# OUTPUT:

![YU](../images/strace.png)



# FIND PROCESS USING A PORT :

To find **which process is using a specific port** in Linux (e.g., `port 8080`), you can use a few common tools like `lsof`, `ss`, or `netstat`.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Using `lsof` (most direct)**

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<port>
```


## üß™ Bonus: Find All Listening Ports

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```
# EXAMPLE:

lsof -p 4646 | head -5

# OUTPUT:
![i](../images/lsof.png)
---

## üßæ 1. **Use `ps` for Basic Stats**

```bash
ps -p <PID> -o pid,ppid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,tty,stat,time,cmd
```

### Example:

```bash
ps -p 1 -o pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,time,cmd
ps -p 2 -o pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,time,cmd
ps -p 5 -o pid,%cpu,%mem,vsz,rss,time,cmd
```

| Field  | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `%CPU` | CPU usage                 |
| `%MEM` | Memory usage              |
| `VSZ`  | Virtual memory used (KB)  |
| `RSS`  | Resident memory used (KB) |
| `TIME` | Total CPU time            |
| `CMD`  | Command                   |

---
# OUTPUT:

![ii](../images/psp.png)

## üì¶ 5. **Use `pidstat` (from `sysstat` package)**

```bash
pidstat -p <PID> 1
```

# OUTPUT:

![yv](../images/pidstat.png)

Shows real-time CPU, memory, and I/O stats for a process every second.
