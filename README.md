# 🐧 Linux Coursework – Semester 1

Welcome to my **Linux coursework repository**!  
This project contains all the practical assignments, commands, and scripts I completed as part of **Semester 1 Linux training**. The aim is to provide a structured, easy-to-follow overview of basic to intermediate Linux concepts using real examples and hands-on scripting.

Whether you're a beginner starting out with Linux or someone reviewing this for reference — you're in the right place! 🌱

## 📘 Detailed Folder Descriptions

### 🔹 `BASIC COMMANDS/`
> 💡 *Learn the basics of interacting with the Linux terminal.*

- Commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, and more.
- Understanding file paths, directory navigation, and simple file handling.
- A great starting point for beginners who are new to Linux.

---

### 🔹 `ADVANCE COMMANDS/`
> ⚙️ *Going beyond the basics into more powerful Linux commands.*

- Working with file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Viewing processes and system resources (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
- Redirecting input/output (`>`, `>>`, `|`, `tee`)
- Learning about piping and command chaining

---

### 🔹 `INSTALLATION/`
> 🛠️ *Step-by-step guides for installing Linux or specific packages.*

- Linux distribution installation (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali)
- Package installation using tools like `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`
- Network and tool setup instructions
- Includes screenshots (see `images/` folder)

---

### 🔹 `LINUS ASSIGNMENTS/`
> 📚 *Formal assignments from the course.*

- Written answers, script submissions, and command outputs.
- Useful for review and exam preparation.
- Shows application of learned concepts in structured formats.

---

### 🔹 `PRACTICE CODE/`
> 🧪 *My own experimentation zone!*

- Self-practice beyond the curriculum.
- Includes creative uses of shell scripting.
- Helps solidify concepts through repetition and custom challenges.

---

### 🔹 `SHELL SCRIPTING/`
> 🐚 *The heart of Linux automation.*

This folder contains `.md` files with **actual Bash shell scripts** for performing specific tasks.

#### 📝 Example Scripts Include:

| 🗂️ File Name | 🔍 What It Does |
|-------------|------------------|
| `armstrong_no.md` | Checks if a number is an Armstrong number |
| `basic_shellcommands.md` | Simple shell command collection |
| `check file permission.md` | Script to check and report file permissions |
| `count_lines.md` | Counts number of lines in a file |
| `factorial_func.md` | Calculates factorial using a function |
| `palindrome_num.md` | Checks if a number is a palindrome |

> 📌 **Note:** These scripts are in `.md` format for explanation and readability. You can convert them to `.sh` files to run them in a terminal.

## 🧠 Skills Developed

By completing this coursework, I've learned and practiced the following core Linux skills:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 💻 Linux CLI | Mastered navigation, file operations, and terminal commands |
| 🛠️ System Configuration | Learned to install packages, set permissions, and manage users |
| 🐚 Shell Scripting | Automated tasks using `bash`, loops, conditionals, and functions |
| 🔒 Permissions | Used `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask` to control access |
| 📋 Process Management | Handled jobs using `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `bg`, `fg` |
| ⏰ Cron Jobs (Intro) | Basic automation using `crontab` (coming soon!) |
